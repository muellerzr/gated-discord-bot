"""
To run this script, in a screen session just do `python student_verification_bot.py`

I keep all of my env vars in a .env file which `load_dotenv()` loads into the environment.

Env variables:
- DISCORD_TOKEN: comes from the discord API. 
                 You will need to make a discord app for your bot which will DM users,
                 and give it permission to create DMs. I'd recommend asking chatgpt for help with this. 
- CHANNEL_ID: The ID from Discord for your channel that contains the message. 
              (Enable developer tools, right click on a channel -> Copy Channel ID)
- MESSAGE_ID: The ID for the individual discord message users will be interacting with the "+" emoji
- DATABASE_PATH: Where the user database should be stored on disk. Mine is saved to `student_emails.db`
